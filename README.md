# Nexus

## About
Nexus is a plugin for the Minecraft server software
[Spigot](https://hub.spigotmc.org). It adds items with recipes, and is
meant for play in regular Survival Mode, but it should work in other kinds
of servers too.

You can connect to the test server by connecting to `mc.unbreakinggold.ml`
or `unbreakinggold.ml` in Minecraft: Java Edition. There is no Bedrock
Edition server or proxy yet. The server is hosted at
[FMCS](https://panel.freemcserver.net/user/register?ref=311353).
